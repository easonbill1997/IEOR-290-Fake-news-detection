This UI is constructed based on a template created by Karan Bhanot.

## Preparing the UI
Open  two terminals. In the first terminal, go inside the ui folder using cd ui. Make sure you are using the node version 10.4.1. Once inside the folder, run the command yarn install to install all dependencies.
To run the UI on server, we will use serve. We will begin by installing the serve globally, post which, weâ€™ll build our application and then finally run the UI using serve on port 3000.
